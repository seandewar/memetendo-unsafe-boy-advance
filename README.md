A [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance) emulator,
written in Rust. ðŸ¦€

## Status

Unfinished; I'll be working on this in my spare time (for fun!) :)

It's able to play most games, and has audio support!  
[Here's a video of it running DOOM!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdFqmEEttws)

As for tests, it currently passes:
- [FuzzARM](https://github.com/DenSinH/FuzzARM).
- Most [gba-tests](https://github.com/jsmolka/gba-tests).
- Most [gba\_tests](https://github.com/destoer/gba_tests).
- [ARMWrestler GBA](https://github.com/destoer/armwrestler-gba-fixed).
- Most tests in [shonumi/Emu-Docs](https://github.com/shonumi/Emu-Docs/tree/master/GameBoy%20Advance/test_roms).
- Most things in [PeterLemon/GBA](https://github.com/PeterLemon/GBA).
- ...and others!

## Building

Memetendo Unsafe Boy Advance currently targets Rust 1.72, but supports Rust 1.70
as a minimum.

Just use `cargo build` to build (optionally passing the `--release` argument to
build with full optimizations), or `cargo run` to build and run.

Instructions for building Web Memetendo can be found
[here](web-memetendo/README.md).

## Tests

Run `cargo test` to run tests.  

Some slow tests are ignored by default in debug builds.  
Consider using `cargo test -- --ignored` to run them, or test with optimizations
enabled via `cargo test --release`.

Integration tests exist that automate the running of various test ROMs.  
To set them up, download the submodules in this repository by using
`git submodule update --init` and copy a GBA BIOS ROM to
`/libmemetendo/tests/bios.bin` (if not provided, [Cult-of-GBA's BIOS](https://github.com/Cult-of-GBA/BIOS)
will be used instead, but it does not currently pass [jsmolka's](https://github.com/jsmolka/gba-tests)
BIOS tests).

## Performance

Memetendo Unsafe Boy Advance uses a per-pixel based software renderer, which
allows for graphical effects that modify video state mid-scanline to work, but
performs badly in general.

There's room for optimization, but in the future, I'd like to add a per-scanline
based renderer instead, falling back to the per-pixel based renderer only if
mid-scanline video state changes are detected.

Maybe I'll also consider adding a hardware-accelerated renderer too at some
point? Who knows!

## What's with the name?

And as of writing, Memetendo Unsafe Boy Advance does not actually use any
`unsafe` (non-dependency) code.

## Why Rust and not Zig?

What a very specific question! The vote was very close:

So there was a tie-breaker...

Rustaceans win this time! ðŸ¦€
